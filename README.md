## Overview
The **Intelligent Text Assistant** is a machine learning and NLP-based solution that performs tasks such as:
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries for large pieces of text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze text to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
- **Translation**: Translate text between different languages.
- **Image Captioning**: Generate captions for images based on their content.

It is designed for users looking to automate and streamline text analysis efficiently.

---

## Features
- **Text Summarization**: Create short summaries from lengthy text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment of text data.
- **Translation**: Translate input text into multiple languages.
- **Image Captioning**: Generate descriptive captions for images.

---

## Technologies Used
This project leverages the following tools and technologies:
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **NLP Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Pillow), and pre-trained vision models.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub for version control.

## Usage
1. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main Python script to start the text assistant tool.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Perform Text and Image Operations**:
   - Input a block of text or an image file.
   - Select the desired operation:
     - **Summarization**
     - **Sentiment Analysis**
     - **Translation**
     - **Image Captioning**
   - View the results on the console or output file.

3. **Example Commands**:
   - Text Summarization:
     ```bash
     python app.py --task summarize --input "input_text_file.txt"
     ```
   - Translation:
     ```bash
     python app.py --task translate --input "input_text_file.txt" --lang "fr"
     ```
   - Image Captioning:
     ```bash
     python app.py --task caption --input "image_file.jpg"
     ```
